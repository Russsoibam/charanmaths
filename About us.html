	Reconnect & Engage Students Quickly

 

Our tuition centreis a hybrid student recovery program. It focuses on aggressive outreach to reconnect students on their academic journey. We employ several outreach strategies to assist students to succeed in their academics and in life. Mentors outreach and build rapport with students to earn their trust and ensure their academic progress. With declining enrollment nationally and with distance learning models becoming more prevalent, we believe that it is an essential program that would assist districts to provide quality education and services to their students and families.
